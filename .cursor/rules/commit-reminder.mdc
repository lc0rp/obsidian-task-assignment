# Commit Reminder Rule

## When to Apply

After making any code changes, edits, or modifications to files in the workspace, ALWAYS end your response with a commit
reminder.

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format with scope:

- **Format**: `type(scope): description`
- **Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- **Scope**: Use appropriate scope based on what was changed (e.g., modal, settings, ui, docs, api)
- **Description**: Brief description of what was changed

## Required Final Message

The last line of your message should ALWAYS be:

"Don't forget to commit!" followed by the git command with conventional commit message.

## Examples

### For UI changes

```text
Don't forget to commit!
git add . && git commit -m "feat(ui): add help links to modal and settings pages"
```

### For bug fixes

```text
Don't forget to commit!
git add . && git commit -m "fix(modal): resolve assignment parsing issue"
```

### For documentation

```text
Don't forget to commit!
git add . && git commit -m "docs: update README with new features"
```

### For styling

```text
Don't forget to commit!
git add . && git commit -m "style: improve help link appearance and responsiveness"
```

## Scope Guidelines

- `ui` - User interface changes
- `modal` - Changes to modal dialogs
- `settings` - Settings page modifications
- `core` - Core plugin functionality
- `docs` - Documentation updates
- `build` - Build system changes
- `test` - Testing related changes
