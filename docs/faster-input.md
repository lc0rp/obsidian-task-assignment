I'd like to introduce a syntax where you can type faster. Currently, for roles, you have to find the icon, which means you might need to use the dialogue that appears. I'd like to propose that when you click the dialogue, it pops up immediately. In the settings, you could define a key for each role. For example, a backslash and 'R' could launch the roles picker, bringing up a dropdown. You could easily select a role or use slash 'R D' to specify 'driver', and it would immediately insert the role, making typing faster.

Consider changing the syntax to dataview inline properties.
